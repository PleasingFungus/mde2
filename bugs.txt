Bugs!

To Reproduce
	crash in loading can cause "lockup" on blank screen instead of going to crash screen (possibly: crash in crash-handling code?)
To Fix
	delays in tooltips in module menus don't update with config (I-DEMUX doesn't display delay, wide modules only display log of default width, etc)
	average ticks/instruction can be less than 1 (seen on JMP/BEQ levels, e.g. http://pleasingfungus.com/mde2/index.html?lvl=9&code=88124045519b9bcc4ddad1e4ea38056a
	initial slider position incorrect - ref e.g. snapping backwards when arrow pressed to go 0 -> 1, on 'number' module
	mouseover tooltips on main menu bar slide when scrolling
	custom modules
		can copy cmodules containing modules not allowed in level
		crash on doubly recursive custom module - from module at top , 28&cfe433847d9d7fc3e5f76257ac9db453
		custom module functionality mismatch - 20&code=4d2b3cd039bff0cc9f93d356a688f8ad
			missing internal connections on load?
	asymmetrical behavior by order of part placement (in delay levels only?)
	thickness problem when zooming back in (when lines are (partially?) offscreen? onscreen?)
	links occasionally turn gray (???) (same bug as above?)
	hitting random-mem when scrolled down in the memory list creates an empty area at the top of the list
	comments for addm/savem are too verbose
Known But Not Currently Fixable
	test positioning issues
			flashrects (hints for new modules) are 'above' tooltips; shouldn't be
			node text displays over the top of held modules 'covering' the current module
