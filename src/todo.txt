3 data structures
	2x lines (non-directional): horizontal (coord of left pt), vertical (coord of top pt)
	1x connection (single point): list of connectors or null
	on place wire:
		check each pointpair in line grid; if taken, abort
		mark each line occupied
		check endpoints for non-self 
		mark each point as potential connection (push to list or create list)
	modules 1.5x1.5 gridsize min; centers offset by .5 gridsize
	on place module:
		check each occupied line in line grid; if taken, abort
		mark each occupied line
		check connection points (must by offset by .5 again, so on the grid)
		mark connection points
